### URL Path
/api/users/create (Internal use only)

### Request Parameters
- **name** (`str`): Name of the person creating an account.
  - Example: `John Doe`

}
```

### Response

Upon successful creation of the user, a JSON object containing `id`, `name`, and `email` is returned. If there are any issues with creating an account (e.g., invalid email format), appropriate error messages will be included in this response.

#### Example Successful Response

    ""error"": {
        ""code"": 400,
        ""message"": ""Email format invalid.""

# `createSession` function

## Overview

The `createSession` function initializes a new session for user authentication purposes. It generates a unique identifier (session ID) along with the associated user's identification.

## Parameters

- **userId**: A string representing the unique identifier of an existing authenticated user.
  - Type: String
  - Description: The UserID to which this newly created session will be linked.

## Returns

```javascript
{
  id: 's1', // Unique Session ID (example value)
  userId: <userId> // Associated user's identification passed as a parameter
}
```

- **id**: A unique identifier for the new session.
- **userId**: The UserID associated with this newly created session.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const mySession = createSession('12345');
console.log(mySession); 
// Output:
// { id: 's1', userId: '12345' }
```

In this example, a new session object is generated for the `userId` `'12345'`, with an assigned unique ID of `'s1'`.

# Send Email Operation

## Summary
Asynchronously sends an email to a specified recipient with given subject and message content.

## Description
The `sendEmail` operation is designed for sending emails asynchronously. It requires three parameters: 
- **to** (string): The recipient's email address.
- **subject** (string): Subject line of the email.
- **body** (string): Body text/content of the email to be sent.

## Parameters
| Name | Type   | Description                  |
|------|--------|------------------------------|
| `to` | string | Recipient's email address.  |
| `subject` | string | Email subject line.         |
| `body`    | string | Body text/content of the message.|

## Response Model (Optional)
The response model is not defined as this operation does not return any data.

```json
{
  ""status"": ""success"",
  ""message"": ""Email sent successfully.""
}
```

Note: The actual implementation details, such as error handling and success status messages are abstracted in the above documentation. In a real-world scenario, these would be more detailed based on how `sendEmail` is implemented.

## Overview
This function adds an item with a specified SKU and quantity to your shopping cart.

### Prerequisites
- You must have access to `cart_id` which uniquely identifies your existing cart. If you don't already have one, you'll need to create it first using the appropriate API endpoint.
  
  Example: `[Create Cart] /api/cart/create`

## How-to Steps

1. **Prepare Your Data**
   - Define a unique string for `cart_id`.
   - Specify an item SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) as per your inventory system's format, e.g., `""B123""`, `""A456""`.
   - Optionally set the quantity (`qty`) of this item you want to add. The default value is 1.

2. **Call `add_item` Function**
   ```python
   result = add_item(cart_id=""your_cart_id"", sku=""item_sku"")
   ```
   
3. **Handle Response** (Optional)
   - If the function returns a dictionary, it typically contains information about whether adding was successful and details of your updated cart.
     Example:
     ```json
     {
       ""success"": true,
       ""cart_items_updated"": 1,
       ""message"": ""Item added successfully.""
     }
     ```
   
4. **Error Handling**
   - If the function encounters an error (e.g., invalid `sku`, insufficient quantity), it may return a dictionary with details about what went wrong.
     Example:
     ```json
     {
       ""success"": false,
       ""error_message"": ""Invalid SKU provided.""
     }
     ```

5. **Repeat as Necessary**
   - You can call this function multiple times to add different items or update quantities for existing ones in your cart.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `cart_id` is valid and corresponds with an active shopping session.
- The quantity of each item added should not exceed what's available according to inventory levels. Check stock availability before adding large orders if necessary through a separate API endpoint like `[Check Stock] /api/stock/check`.
  
Remember, this function does nothing by itself; it needs the correct parameters and context (like an active cart session) for successful execution in your shopping platform's ecosystem."

## What is the purpose of the `removeItem` function?

The `removeItem` function removes an item from a shopping cart. It takes two parameters: `cartId`, which identifies the specific cart, and `sku`, representing the Stock Keeping Unit or unique identifier for each product.

---

## How do I use this API to remove an item from my cart?

To call the `removeItem` function:

1. Obtain your user's current shopping cart ID.
2. Identify the SKU of the item you wish to remove using a query like `/api/products/{sku}` (replace `{sku}` with actual product's SKU).
3. Call this API endpoint: 

```
/api/cart/remove-item?cartId={yourCartId}&sku={productSku}
```

Replace `yourCartId` and `productSku` accordingly.

---

## What happens if the cart ID or SKU is incorrect?

If either parameter (`cartId` or `sku`) provided to this function does not exist, it will result in an error. The server typically responds with a 404 status code for non-existent resources (e.g., invalid Cart ID) and/or a 400 Bad Request when parameters are missing/malformed.

---

## Can I remove multiple items at once?

No, the `removeItem` function is designed to handle one item removal per call only. To delete several products from your cart simultaneously, you would need additional logic on both client-side (to iterate through SKUs) and server-side (if supported by API).

---

## What kind of response can I expect after removing an item?

Upon successful execution:

- The function will return a success message or status code indicating the removal was processed correctly.
  
In case there is any issue, you may receive error messages detailing what went wrong. Common errors include invalid cart ID/sku and insufficient permissions.

---

## Is this API secure for handling sensitive data like Cart IDs?

Yes, `removeItem` should be part of a secured endpoint that authenticates the user before processing requests to ensure only authorized users can modify their carts' contents.
